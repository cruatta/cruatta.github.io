I did get some sleep between the two days ;)
Background My first CTF on my own! I&amp;rsquo;m part of a group of developers at Credit Karma, where I currently work, who voluntarily participate in security trainings where we learn offensive security techniques from our AppSec team. We&amp;rsquo;ve done individual challenges, like executing a XSS on a vulnerable form or performing SQLi to change a password on a vulnerable website, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never done a CTF before.</description></item></channel></rss>

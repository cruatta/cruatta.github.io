I&rsquo;m part of a group of developers at Credit Karma, where I currently work, who voluntarily participate in security trainings where we learn offensive security techniques from our AppSec team. We&rsquo;ve done individual challenges, like executing a XSS on a vulnerable form or performing SQLi to change a password on a vulnerable website, but I&rsquo;ve never done a CTF before. It was really rewarding getting that last flag! I&rsquo;ll definitely be doing this again.</p><h2 id=day-1>Day 1</h2><p>I got inspired to do some pentesting because I started the day on hackerone, reading vulnerability reports. I set my sights very high after that. I found a website that has a bug bounty program and started doing some research on this site. After about 6 or 7 hours and coming up mostly empty handed, I decided to switch gears to a CTF. At least this way I figured I could practice my skills and maybe learn a thing or two to help me make more progress in real bug bounties.</p><p>I jumped on vulnhub.com and looked at some of the new entries and found <a href=https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/dc-1-1,292/#>this OVA</a>. From the description, it looked good for a beginner and I saw in the preview image there was a Drupal website which took me back to the days of maintaining these things for clients&hellip; fond memories.</p><p>I downloaded the OVA and booted it up in Virtualbox and I was greeted by a root login prompt as the Virtualbox image finished spinning up. All I knew at this point was this was a Debian 7 box and there was a root user. Not much to go on.</p><p><img src=static/deb001.png alt=virtualbox title=Virtualbox></p><p>Looking at the instructions, the VM was configured to get an IP address via DHCP so I took a look at the Virtualbox adapter settings. After checking my host configuration, I got my own IP address on that NIC and did a simple nmap ping scan against the network from my Kali VM.</p><pre><code class=language-bash>$ sudo nmap -sP 10.217.20.1/24

</code></pre><p>Cool! My CTF VM was sitting on 10.217.20.190. The next thing I wanted to do was see if I could access it from a web browser, since I know it&rsquo;s running Drupal.</p><p><img src=static/drupal001.png alt=drupal title=Drupal></p><p>Success! Now I had something to work with&hellip; except that this Drupal site was <em>really</em> bare bones. I tried creating an account to see if I could login but I was prompted with a notice that my account creation was being approved by an administrator. Yeah, that was not going to happen. At that point there wasn&rsquo;t much I could do with the site other than to request a password reset or login.</p><p>So the next thing I thought of was sqlmap since I needed to escalate my privileges to that of an existing user or run some kind of RCE and this website was filled with forms.</p><p>Busting out sqlmap against each form proved not to be very very useful</p><pre><code>$ root@kali:~/Downloads# sqlmap -u &quot;http://10.217.20.190/user/password&quot; --data=&quot;name=a&amp;pass=a&amp;form_build_id=a&amp;form_id=a&amp;op=a&quot; -p name --level=5
</code></pre><p>I tried various iterations of the above, selecting different parameters to test, different endpoints associated with all the forms, and with no luck. The closest I got to something was this:</p><pre><code>[22:37:21] [INFO] target URL appears to be UNION injectable with 9 columns
</code></pre><p>But reading up on this, I discovered <a href=https://sourceforge.net/p/sqlmap/mailman/message/28998736/>this information can be ambiguous</a> to whether or not there is an actual SQL inection opportunity. I let the scan run at level 5 and risk 3 but got nothing. Looking back, was this sqlmap actually touching on Drupalgeddon?! I&rsquo;ll share the results of my test at the end of this post.</p><p>At this point, I decided I needed to take a different approach. I decided to take a look at what other services were running on this VM. I ran a quick nmap scan to see what I could find.</p><pre><code class=language-bash>root@kali:~/shell# nmap -v -sS 10.217.20.190 -p1-65535

</code></pre><p>Not too exciting. I learned that sometimes rpcbind is vulnerable to <a href=https://github.com/guidovranken/rpcbomb/>attack</a> and sometimes you can mount nfs volumes over the network if it is, but I didn&rsquo;t see nfs running after doing an <code>rpcinfo</code> command. I could have taken a better look at ssh but I know OpenSSH vulnerabilities that might allow me to bypass authentication or perform RCE are <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/product/585/Openbsd-Openssh.html?vendor_id=97">very rare</a>.</p><p>So with that in mind, I decided to take another look at Drupal. This time, I did a quick search of Drupal CVEs and immediately found Drupalgeddon v2. Knowing that this version of Drupal probably predates v2, I searched for <a href=https://www.sektioneins.de/en/advisories/advisory-012014-drupal-pre-auth-sql-injection-vulnerability.html>Drupalgeddon v1</a> which is a damaging SQL inection. It seems to be commonly used to inject a new password for an existing user into the Drupal <code>users</code> database table, allowing an attacker to assume administrator privileges. At this point I knew I had something good because Drupalgeddon v1 affected Drupal 7 and this looked like a Drupal 7 site. I found a simple <a href=https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/34993>PoC</a> on exploitdb, reviewed the code, modified it for my needs and went to work.</p><pre><code class=language-bash>root@kali:/tmp/mozilla_root0# php 34993.php 
Success! Log in with username &quot;admin&quot; and password &quot;admin&quot; at http://10.217.20.190user/login
</code></pre><p>Viola! Progress!</p><p>After logging in, I was greeted with your standard administrative UI for Drupal. Clicking over to Posts page, I found my first flag!</p><pre><code>Special PERMS will help FIND the passwd - but you'll need to -exec that command to work out how to get what's in the shadow.
</code></pre><p>Which happened to be flag3. At this point I decided to call it quits for the night and resume in the morning.</p><h2 id=day-2>Day 2</h2><p>Logging back in as admin to Drupal, I set out to get a shell. After a bit of research, I learned that there&rsquo;s a module in Drupal, called PHP Filter, that allows users to write PHP code in the <code>Create Content</code> UI and have them executed on page load. Enabling the PHP Filter through the module system, I created a simple test page with PHP content.</p><p><img src=static/php001.png alt=php title=php></p><p><img src=static/php002.png alt=php title=php></p><p>With my test run a success, I ran <code>ls -la</code> and found flag1!</p><pre><code>Every good CMS needs a config file - and so do you.
</code></pre><p>I knew this meant flag2 was probably in the database but I decided that I&rsquo;d already come this far, I might as well go for the final flag. Now that I had exec, it was time for me to get a shell because using exec and shell_exec in the Drupal UI was not ideal for exploring the filesystem. My first attempt at a shell was a simple reverse php shell that I found <a href=https://highon.coffee/blog/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet/>on the reverse shell cheat sheet</a>. After several increasingly complex attempts at getting a reverse shell and failing for unknown reasons, I decided a web shell might be a better option. Kali comes with a very capable PHP web shell in <code>/usr/share/webshells/php/php-backdoor.php</code> and since I had the ability to upload PHP directly through the UI, I copied and pasted the code in a now I had a shell!</p><p><img src=static/shell001.png alt=shell title=shell></p><p>From here I started digging around the file system and found the fourth flag in <code>/home/flag4/flag4.txt</code></p><pre><code>Can you use this same method to find or access the flag in root? Probably. But perhaps it's not that easy. Or maybe it is? 
</code></pre><p>This was a huge hint and I knew I was almost finished. I navigated to /root/ in my webshell and got a permissions error.</p><pre><code>opendir() failed
</code></pre><p>I started out trying to <code>cat /root/flag5.txt</code> but that failed immediately with a similar permissions error. After brainstorming for some time and continuing to poke around the system, I finally decided to reexamine the contents of <code>/home/flag4/</code> and that&rsquo;s when it hit me. The permissions for this home directory were odd, most home directories are not world readable! This might mean that there are files in /root/ which are world readable that I can&rsquo;t see because I&rsquo;m missing permissions for the top level directory. This is where <code>find</code> came in handy. I ran this command in my web shell</p><pre><code>http://10.217.20.190/node/5?c=find+%2Froot+
</code></pre><p>and the output was exactly what I&rsquo;d hoped for!</p><pre><code>/root
/root/.profile
/root/.drush
...
/root/thefinalflag.txt
...
/root/.bashrc
/root/.aptitude
/root/.aptitude/config
</code></pre><p>But <code>cat</code> again failed to read the file. That&rsquo;s when I remembered the hint from the previous day. I crafted this find command to determine the permissions of all the files in /root</p><pre><code>find /root -printf &quot;%f: %p: %u: %g %m (%M) \n&quot; 
</code></pre><pre><code>root: /root: root: root 700 (drwx------) 
...
thefinalflag.txt: /root/thefinalflag.txt: root: root 644 (-rw-r--r--) 
...
</code></pre><p>And ran the final find command to get the contents of the last flag</p><pre><code>find /root/thefinalflag.txt -exec cat {} \;
</code></pre><pre><code class=language-bash>Well done!!!!
